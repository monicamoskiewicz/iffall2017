	<h1> Improvement Plan </h1>
	<h2> Feedback </h2>
	<p> One of the first things I'm going to do to improve my lyric page is delete the Go Gina falling words, since it would be hard for me to implement them with my real html page. I'm also going to change the title from bright pink to white so it is better integrated into my design. My partner, Zihan, recommended I make the blue box somewhat transparent to give the background and foreground some contrast. However, I decided to delete the box completely so it wasn't so removed from the rest of the page. I may also delete Album: Ctrl, to bring more attention to the song title and artist. </p>

	<p> One of the things I noticed as I was improving my webpage was that the image didn't match with the feeling of the song. I decided to include butterflies because the song is upbeat and it's an image that is used throughout the artist's album. </p>
