			[Verse] </br>
			Hey love, I lost you babe </br>
			Picking up a penny with a press-on is </br>
			Easier than holding you down </br>
			Can't be any harder than holding you up now </br>
			To come clean I said </br>
			(To come clean is to come clean) </br>
			To be real is to be real, it's </br>
			Probably true what they say about me </br>
			Probably came from my inner circle </br>
			It usually come from your inner circle </br>
			Or lack thereof and I don't know who I can trust </br>
			I've been dropping out and </br>
			I've been hanging out with my high friends </br>
			And we too stoned to pay attention, now </br>
			(Much too cool for 7th grade) </br>
			I mean really, it's same me, it's old me </br>
			You know? Same shit </br>
			I've been on the low key grinding </br>
			(Grinding, grinding, grinding) </br>
			Learning on the low key, shining </br>
			Tryin' to keep to myself </br>
			But you bring me out of character </br>
			Every time again
	
			</br>

			</br>
			[Chorus] </br>
			Damn Gina, damn Gina </br>
			Them jeans, they must be uptight mama </br>
			You need some get right mama </br>
			Go Gina, go Gina </br>
			Go get that get right mama </br>
			Go Gina, go Gina </br>
			Go 'til you get right mama </br>
			
	
			</br>
			[Bridge] </br>
			I belong to nobody </br>
			Hope it don't bother you </br>
			You could mind your business </br>
			I belong to nobody </br>
			Try not to disturb </br>
			And mind my business </br>

		
			</br>
			[Outro] </br>
			Still works for me, it works for me, no </br>
			It works for me, it works for me, no </br>
			(Go Gina, go Gina) </br>
			Still works for me, it works for me, no </br>
			It works for me, it works for me, no </br>
			(Go Gina, go Gina) </br>
			Still works for me, it works for me, no </br>
			It works for me, it works for me, no </br>
			(Go Gina, go Gina) </br>
			Still works for me, it works for me, no </br>
			It works for me, it works for me, no </br>
			(Go Gina, go Gina) </br>
