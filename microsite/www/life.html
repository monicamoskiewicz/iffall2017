    <h1> LIFE </h1>
    <p> On his birthday in 2010, Frank Ocean changed his name to Christopher Francis Ocean through a legal website. The change was reportedly partly inspired by the 1960 film Ocean's 11. In November 2014, TMZ revealed that the name change has not been legalized. On April 23, 2015, Ocean successfully changed his legal name to Frank Ocean.

    Ocean wrote an open letter, initially intended for the liner notes on Channel Orange, that preemptively addressed speculation about his attraction in the past to another man. Instead, on July 4, 2012, he published an open letter on his Tumblr blog recounting unrequited feelings he had for another young man when he was 19 years old, citing it as his first true love. He used the blog to thank the man for his influence, and also thanked his mother and other friends, saying "I don't know what happens now, and that's alrite. I don't have any secrets I need kept anymore...I feel like a free man." </p>
