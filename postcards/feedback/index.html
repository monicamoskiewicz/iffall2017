	<h2> Sukari Stone feedback from Monica Moskiewicz </h2>
	<h3> Aesthetic </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The design aligns with the quirkiness of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>.</li>
		<li> The imagery supports the funny quotes that Sukari chose. </li>
		<li> The aesthetic is consistent across all three desktop and mobile mock-ups. </li>
		<li> The quotes were hard to read at certain points so I recommended Sukari darken the images or change the placement of the quote. </li>
		<li> I told Sukari she could add the network or show symbol to make the postcards more cohesive.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3> Structure </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> The visual priority are the images, since they're colorful and stand out more so than the text.</li>
			<li> The images are visually pleasing in both desktop and mobile viewpoints.</li>
		</ul>
	<h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	<ul>
		<li> I recommended Sukari possibly try to improve the image quality for the second desktop.</li>
		<li> The webpage loaded quickly so the dimensions of the images were good.</li>
		<li> I believe Sukari won't run into many problems with the desktop and mobile versions at different sizes. </li>
	</ul>
