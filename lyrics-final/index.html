			<b>[Verse]</b>
			<br>
			Hey loveeeeeee, I lost you babe
			<br>
			Picking up a penny with a press-on is
			<br>
			Easier than holding you down
			<br>
			Can't be any harder than holding you up now
			<br>
			To come clean I said
			<br>
			<em>(To come clean is to come clean)</em>
			<br>
			To be real is to be real, it's
			<br>
			Probably true what they say about me
			<br>
			Probably came from my inner circle
			<br>
			It usually come from your inner circle
			<br>
			Or lack thereof and I don't know who I can trust
			<br>
			I've been dropping out and
			<br>
			I've been hanging out with my high friends
			<br>
			And we too stoned to pay attention, now
			<br>
			<em>(Much too cool for 7th grade)</em>
			<br>
			I mean really, it's same me, it's old me
			<br>
			You know? Same shit
			<br>
			I've been on the low key grinding
			<br>
			<em>(Grinding, grinding, grinding)</em>
			<br>
			Learning on the low key, shining
			<br>
			Tryin' to keep to myself
			<br>
			But you bring me out of character
			<br>
			Every time again
			
			<br> <br>
			<b>[Chorus]</b>
			<br>
			Damn Gina, damn Gina
			<br>
			Them jeans, they must be uptight mama
			<br>
			You need some get right mama
			<br>
			Go Gina, go Gina
			<br>
			Go get that get right mama
			<br>
			Go Gina, go Gina
			<br>
			Go 'til you get right mama
			<br><br>
			<b>[Bridge]</b>
			<br>
			I belong to nobody
			<br>
			Hope it don't bother you
			<br>
			You could mind your business
			<br>
			I belong to nobody
			<br>
			Try not to disturb
			<br>
			And mind my business
			<br> <br>
			<b>[Outro]</b>
			<br>
			Still works for me, it works for me, no
			<br>
			It works for me, it works for me, no
			<br>
			<em>(Go Gina, go Gina)</em>
			<br>
			Still works for me, it works for me, no
			<br>
			It works for me, it works for me, no
			<br>
			<em>(Go Gina, go Gina)</em>
			<br>
			Still works for me, it works for me, no
			<br>
			It works for me, it works for me, no
			<br>
			<em>(Go Gina, go Gina)</em>
			<br>
			Still works for me, it works for me, no
			<br>
			It works for me, it works for me, no
			<br>
			<em>(Go Gina, go Gina)</em>
